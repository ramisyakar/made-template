## Background

This code repository developed during the course Methods of Advanced Data Engineering in winter semester 2023/24 of the MSc. Data Science at FAU (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg)
This repository contains 
- a data science project that is developed by the student over the course of the semester,
- the exercises that are submitted over the course of the semester.

The assignment was to create a data engineering project that processes data from at least two publicly accessible datasources using an automated datapipeline and reports some conclusions.
